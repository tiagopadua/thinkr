Project ideas
=============

Some ideas I have, to make into the project.

Softare as a person
-------------------

The main idea is to simulate the thought of a human being.
To do so, the software must think it is a person.

Concepts, thoughts, experiences, memories, 'states of mind', judgements and senses are some things it is intended to have.

### Senses
The definition of ''sense'' is a physiological capacity of organisms to gather data for perception.

These will be our software version of it. Initially will be text input by the console, but further on we may gather internet text data, and maybe images, sound and video input on a very optimistic future.


### Concepts
These are actually the basic element of our e-brain.

Probably defined by an ID, it may have relations to experiences, memories or other concepts.

### Experiences

Something learned through senses

### Memories

.

### Thoughts

The actual ''engine'' that runs and connects/linkseverything and ends in an action/output.

### State of mind

Will change the way the whole thought process work, according to the level of agreement between its own data and the things it is sensing.

May be an advanced feature.

### Judgement

?
